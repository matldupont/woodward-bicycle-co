title: About Woodward Bicycle Co.
heading: "Hi, I'm Lukasz Dybinski."
paragraph1: >-
  I worked as the Master Mechanic at MEC Ottawa for 6 years, before starting
  Woodward Bicycle Co. in the summer of 2018. I'm passionate about bikes, and
  launched WBco with the intention to transform the typical experience of
  getting your bike serviced into a personal, fun, and efficient one.
paragraph2: >-
  I'm committed to service excellence, and to help people get outside, enjoy
  their rides, and get excited about their bikes.
paragraph3: >-
  To ensure there is enough time to create this experience (and to avoid
  lengthly wait times for you), I provide services by appointment only. If you
  don't see an appointment time that works for you, give me a shout and we'll
  find one.
paragraph4: 'Dang! '
